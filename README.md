Codes for various machine learning approaches
1. Linear Regression (car_prices.ipynb)
2. Logistic Regression (student_results.ipynb)
3. Neural Networks (binary__classification.ipynb)

This repository shows cost function, gradient descent, vectorization, normalization, regularization
All of this is done in raw format without using ML libraries like scikit-learn, etc.
NB: For Deep Learning Tensorflow is used.
